AI Research Standard
==========================

*The standard of AI documentation defined here, please followed the instruction.*

.. note::

    If the project written in Python, you must create ``requirements.txt`` file 
    at the start of each project. When a library is installed, add it to this 
    file immediately.  

AI Research step-by-step:
 - Choose topics
 - Literature review, include:

  - Find the dataset, check the licence.
  - Implemetation available method with the avaliable data.
  - Serach for code, pretrained models, checkpoints if avaliable.
 
 - Choose the aims, question of the research.
 - Create or choose datasets, data is the most important part.
 - Apply the researched models, find the problems of each model.
 - Evaluate, improve, modify or propose models or create new pipeline depends on the insights of data.

*Make sure that all the steps will be recored as document and slide.*

Target:

 - Define some **attributes** to be used as the input *feature vector* by the
   algorithms.
 - Define a **target** attribute to be predicted by the algorithms.
 - Give a **dataset** to be used as a *training set* by the algorithms.
