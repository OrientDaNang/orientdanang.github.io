AI - Machine Learning
=====================

AI Research Suggestion
---------------------

*The suggestion of AI documentation defined here, please followed the instruction.*

.. note::

    If the project written in Python, you must create ``requirements.txt`` file 
    at the start of each project. When a library is installed, add it to this 
    file immediately.  

AI Research suggested steps
---------------------

 - Choose topics
 - Literature review, include:

  - Find the dataset, check the licence.
  - Implementation available method with the available data.
  - Search for code, pretrained models, checkpoints if available.
 
 - Choose the aims, question of the research.
 - Create or choose datasets, data is the most important part.
 - Apply the researched models, find the problems of each model.
 - Evaluate, improve, modify or propose models or create new pipeline depends on the insights of data.

**Make sure that all the steps will be recorded as document and slide.**

Target:

 - Define some **attributes** to be used as the input *feature vector* by the
   algorithms.
 - Define a **target** attribute to be predicted by the algorithms.
 - Give a **dataset** to be used as a *training set* by the algorithms.

All the general information such as input, output, samples go here.


Writing a research paper
---------------------

Research paper use LaTeX format, online LaTeX tools can be used, can use free plan: https://www.overleaf.com/

AI Project Suggestion
---------------------

*The suggestion of AI Project documentation defined here, please followed the instruction.*

.. note::

    If the project written in Python, you must create ``requirements.txt`` file 
    at the start of each project. When a library is installed, add it to this 
    file immediately.

AI Project suggested steps
---------------------
  
 - Check the status of dataset, whether it is given or not. For real problem, it should be better if real dataset/test set is given.
 - Literature review, include:

  - Find the dataset, check the licence.
  - Implementation available method with the available data.
  - Search for code, pretrained models, checkpoints if available.

 - Create datasets, data is the most important part.
 - Apply the researched models, find the problems of each model.
 - Evaluate, improve, modify or propose models or create new pipeline depends on the insights of data.
 - Write programs to use the model in client side.
 - Testing
 - Writing research documentation and technical documentation for client side.

**Make sure that all the steps will be recorded as document and slide.**

Target:

 - Working projects.
 - Satisfy accuracy
 - Follow clean code standard.
